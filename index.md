## Acupunture in West Wales 

Practised for over two thousand years, Traditional Acupuncture is aimed at the root of the condition as well as symptoms. By stimulating the body's own healing response and restoring its natural balance, there can be a more permanent resolution of problems. 

Patients usually experience acupuncture as profoundly relaxing. An initial course of weekly treatment is recommended and patients may return for seasonal treatments or maintenance.

To book a consultation, [contact Audley](/contact/).
